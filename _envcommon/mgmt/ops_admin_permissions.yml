# We put this data in a YAML file, rather than directly in an HCL file, as YAML makes it easier for the Gruntwork
# Architecture Catalog tooling to parse the file and add additional data: e.g., if you add an additional service from
# the Architecture Catalog, the Architecture Catalog tooling may add a few extra parameters to this file that are used
# by the new service. It is completely safe for you to add or modify data in this file manually, as the Architecture
# Catalog tooling will only ever add/merge data. Alternatively, if you do not intend to use the Gruntwork Architecture
# Catalog in the future, you could move this data directly into an HCL file instead.
